# SQLite API

SQLiteAPI provides an easy way to use and manage an SQLite 3 database. It's simple and limited
but done to replace a XML, JSON or text file to store data very easily, with all advantages of
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html):

* self-contained
* high-reliability
* embedded
* full-featured
* public-domain,
* SQL database engine.

Tested with Python 2.6 & 2.7
